## TODO

 * renderer: erase text nodes outside parent viewport not possible unless the whole body is erased.
 * we are not using Node.attributes - we should make attributes===props
 * prevent children cascade per property - I dont want all my childs to have a border like me that i'm container
 * when look up for mouse event target - we can associate the element in the renderer buffer and so each visible pixel has its element and the lookup is fastest
