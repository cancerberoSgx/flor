## TODO

 * scrollable.Should be an element and should not have muh impact on the renderer. 

 * we are not using Node.attributes - we should make attributes===props
 * prevent children cascade per property - I dont want all my childs to have a border like me that i'm container
 * when look up for mouse event target - we can associate the element in the renderer buffer and so each visible pixel has its element and the lookup is fastest
